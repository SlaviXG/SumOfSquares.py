Python implementation of Sum-of-Squares optimization
----------------------------------------------------

Sum of squares optimization built on top of
[picos](https://picos-api.gitlab.io/picos/). Easy access to pseudoexpectation
operators for both formulating problems and extracting solutions via rounding
algorithms.
